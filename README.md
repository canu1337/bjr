Bonjour GERMAIN
===

Clone of the popular "Bonjour Madame"-style websites. At least in spirit.  
Gets images from the images/GERMAIN folder.  
Picks one according to the day, and generates an HTML page linking to that image.  
The HTML template used is Astral by HTML5 UP.  
Install **HTML::Template** to use the perl script:  
```
curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
cpanm -i HTML::Template
```
